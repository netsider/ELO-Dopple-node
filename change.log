<h3>All Versions:</h3>
<br><strong>To Do:</strong><br>
• Make all versions choose players (or at least the first one, in regards to Dopple) not using number randomization.<br>
• Make array numbers lower, so there's no blank values.<br>
• Change name of app.post("/node-dopple-main", function() so that it doesn't have same name as EJS file.<br>
• See how hard/easy it is to insert landing page.<br>
• Implement an API.<br>
• PWA.<br>
• Database connectivity.<br>
• Frontend enhancements.<br>
• Login system.<br>
• SSL.<br>
• Implement flag to enable test version and production version.<br>
• <strike>Make form retain locked player state.</strike><br>
• <strike>Make it so anything locking or getting the last round's players, gets the last players from same hidden form element.<br></strike>
• <strike>Change lines 151-170 so it doesn't use same variable checkbox is setting, and then change EJS file to reflect that (make form display checked checkbox if playerArray[0].lockPlayer = 1).</strike><br>
• <strike>Change resetArray into a boolean, since there's no other elements anymore.</strike><br>
• <strike>Cleanup checkbox and reset button logic</strike>.<br>

<br><h3>ELO-Dopple-node\node</h3>
<strong>To Do:</strong><br>
• Make user encounter Dopple player sets only once, to prevent beefing the score up artificially by one user.<br>

<br><h3>ELO-Dopple-node\node-non-dopple</h3>
<br><strong>To Do:</strong><br>
• After making it so all versions don't use numerical selection of players, make this one rate a users photos (for examle, my own photos), completing the app.<br>
• <strike>Make hidden field for second player.</strike><br>
• <strike>Make non-dopple version.</strike><br>
