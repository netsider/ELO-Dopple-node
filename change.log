<h3>All Versions:</h3>

<br><strong>To Do:</strong><br>
•Make each version have own change.log file, and move below into it (this file will no longer be used):



• Make all versions choose players (or at least the first one, in regards to Dopple) not using number randomization.<br>
• Implement flag to enable test version and production version.<br>
• Make it so you can lock each player to the side its on when players locked, so user can easily see score changes, be nier, etc.<br>
• Make array numbers lower, so there's no blank values.<br>
• Change name of app.post("/node-dopple-main", function() so that it doesn't have same name as EJS file.<br>
• See how hard/easy it is to insert landing page.<br>
• Implement an API.<br>
• PWA.<br>
• Database connectivity.<br>
• Frontend enhancements.<br>
• Login system.<br>
• SSL.<br>
• <strike>Change resetArray into a boolean, since there's no other elements anymore.</strike><br>
• <strike>Cleanup checkbox and reset button logic</strike>.<br>

<br><h3>ELO-Dopple-node\node</h3>
<strong>To Do:</strong><br>
• Make it so there's a "designated player" when player, to avoid confusion about who they're voting for (currently it'll randomize the person it's asking for, for each set of people who look alike).<br>
• Make user encounter Dopple player sets only once, to prevent beefing the score up artificially by one user.<br>
