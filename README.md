<h2>Dopple (nodeJS version)</h2>

<strong>Repository Contents:</strong><br>
* <strong>/node</strong> - The regular nodeJS version of Dopple (/ELO-Dopple).<br>
* <strong>/ts</strong> - The typescript version of the nodeJS version of Dopple (/ELO-Dopple -- another Github repository of mine).  Randall Gordon converted it into Typescript.<br>
* <strong>/node-non-dopple</strong> - Regular nodeJS version of Dopple, but without Dopplegangers (you can rank any two players against each other) (/ELO-Dopple).  What is Dopple without Dopplegangers?  Just a voting app!<br>
